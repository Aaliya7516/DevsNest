If we want to pass the data to the last child of a complex structure: <br>
> 1. Without context API, we need to pass the data from parent to child to their child and so on till we reach the destination.<br>
> 2. With context API, we will create a context to store data so that it can be accessed anywhere by any sub-child of the parent. <br>
> But the drawback is, it rerenders the whole page.<br>
> 3. In redux, the page will not re-render and we can use data in multiple places(childs).
